# Brandon Cobb

**Game Developer & Programmer**

Hello there! My name is Brandon and I'm an aspiring game developer and programmer at California State University, Fullerton. I have worked on projects as the lead programmer/designer and as a fill-in 2D artist, sound designer, and composer. Since I was a little kid, gaming has been my absolute favorite hobby. With every game I played, I was passionate about being the best. Fast forward to now, I might not be the best player, but my hunger to learn and improve every day has not changed. Feel free to check out some of the projects I've worked on!

### Game Projects
[Midnight Brew](https://bcthunder.itch.io/midnight-brew) My submission for Pirate Software's Game Jam in July 2024! This was my first game jam and I developed the game solo.
[A Slice of Lunch](https://github.com/Waffle-Fish/A-Slice-of-Lunch.git) Working title for Cal State Fullerton's Video Game Developers Club! I'm learning sound design for this project.
