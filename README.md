# Who am I?

**Game Developer & Programmer**

Hello there! My name is Brandon and I'm an aspiring game developer and programmer at California State University, Fullerton. I have worked on projects as the lead programmer/designer and as a fill-in 2D artist, sound designer, and composer. Since I was a little kid, gaming has been my absolute favorite hobby. With every game I played, I was passionate about being the best. Fast forward to now, I might not be the best player, but my hunger to learn and improve every day has not changed. Feel free to check out some of the projects I've worked on!

### Game Projects
