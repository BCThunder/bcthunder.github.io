# Who am I?

**Game Developer & Programmer**

Hello! I'm Brandon — a game developer and programmer studying Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton (graduating December 2025). I’ve worked across multiple disciplines including gameplay programming, design, front-end development, and music/sound composition.

I grew up grinding competitive games for hours, always focused on improving one step at a time. I bring that same mindset to development: rapid learning, constant iteration, and a drive to create meaningful player experiences.

Feel free to explore some of the projects I've worked on!

I contributed sound design, music, gameplay support, and trailer direction. This was my first major audio-driven role, and it taught me how sound shapes pacing, clarity, and emotional tone.

**Key challenges & solutions:**
- **Learning music production from scratch:** Studied genre references, breaking down what made certain melodies or textures feel cozy and relaxing.
- **Iterating on audio direction:** Used playtest feedback to refine timing, transitions, and reward cues.
- **Improving gameplay feel:** Helped identify issues in responsiveness and feedback loops and aligned audio cues with gameplay moments.
- **Creating the gameplay trailer:** Analyzed genre-leading trailers to highlight pacing, mechanics, and mood effectively.
